Landing page design and content description :
I made the landing page using a warm color scheme and wooden desk table background with a smartphone. This is because even though it is a reminder app, connecting people together is the main purpose of this app. For that reason, I wanted to give the landing page a warm and welcoming theme.

For the marketing content, I added all the information about the app in a simple and easy way to read. I also added icons next to the descriptions because they help users visually get a good grasp of the app. I made it eye catching but also simple to read. 

At the end of the page, I added example messages in quotes that float across the page. This is to give users a good understanding of what messages that they create will look like. 

For the about page, I didn't use too much color since I wanted to give a professional and clean look and feel. 

Behind the scenes :
- I used HTML, LESS, and Javascript for the landing page.
- For the marketing page, I added the carousel at the bottom where messages in quotes slide in and out. It was hard to stop the quotes in the middle for a second after it slides in and after that to slide out.
- For the about page, I created a box for each teammate. If you put your cursor on the box, it gets bigger. If you click the box, then a modal pops up with the cursor bar and you can read their bio and also go to their Github account. 
- For the carousels, I created a component that manipulates the DOM.
